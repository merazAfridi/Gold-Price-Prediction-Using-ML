# Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-ML

This study endeavors to forecast gold prices based on historical data from the preceding year, aiming to provide valuable insights for investors in making informed decisions regarding the optimal timing for buying or selling gold. Within the context of today's interconnected global economy, gold stands as a crucial asset, serving not only as an economic activity indicator but also as a reflection of a country's financial stability. The primary goal of this research is to elucidate the intricate relationships between the response variable, i.e., gold prices, and a multitude of independent variables, including the Stock Market index, Silver price, and the Euro to USD ratio. Leveraging historical data, a suite of machine learning algorithms has been employed to predict gold prices. These algorithms encompass AdaBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, ExtraTrees, GradientBoost, Stacked Generalization, Support Vector, among others. Through the application of these methodologies, the study seeks to enhance our understanding of the dynamic factors influencing gold prices and facilitate more informed decision-making within the realm of investment.

The data for this study was diligently acquired from a wide array of sources, spanning a considerable timeframe from 1980 to 2023. This compilation yielded a substantial dataset comprising approximately 10,581 data points.
